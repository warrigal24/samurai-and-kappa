# The Samurai and the Kappa

By Garry Francis

## Background

Ever since the Battle of Sekigahara and the rise of the Tokugawa shogunate, the samurai have gradually lost their military function to become courtiers, bureaucrats and administrators. This life was not for you, so you find yourself wandering from town to town looking for work where your sword skills are valued. There's always plenty of work escorting dignitaries, or seeking out weapon smugglers and bandits.

Late one evening you wander into a small town. As it's not a post-town, it doesn't have a honjin for high-ranking travellers, so you enter the lobby of a hatagoya that faces the street. You are greeted by the innkeeper, who bows deeply and invites you inside. You don't need much coaxing, as you're looking forward to a bath, a meal and a good night's sleep.

The innkeeper enters the inn to make arrangements, leaving you to remove your waraji.
