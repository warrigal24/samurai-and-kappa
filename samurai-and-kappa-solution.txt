The Samurai and the Kappa

Solution by Garry Francis
----------------------------------------
This is a minimal solution. You'll need to EXAMINE lots of things for this solution to make sense. Some optional (but significant) commands are shown in parentheses. These can be omitted once you know what to do.

The first part of the game is a tutorial where your objective is to have a bath, a meal and a sleep. Something happens during the night. When you get up in the morning and pay your bill, the innkeeper reveals what has happened. From this point on, much of the game is an information gathering exercise so that you can learn how to deal with the kappa. You will need to solve puzzles in order to gather the information you need. TALK TO all the characters you meet and ASK <character> ABOUT anything they mention that seems relevant. Take notes as you go, as any important information you find will be needed later in the game.

The solution assumes that you play the game with the tutorial turned on and follow the advice in the tutorial. It is strongly advised that you leave the tutorial turned on, as it will provide some valuable hints later in the game. If you get stuck, use HINT, but only as a last resort.
